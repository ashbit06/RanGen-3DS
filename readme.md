# RanGen 3DS

this is a port of my [rangen ce](https://github.com/ashbit06/RanGen_CE) game for the ti-84 plus ce graphing calculator

## how to play

- ~~dpad to move/jump~~
- start to exit
- left shoulder button to regenerate the map
- ~~right shoulder button to reset your position~~

## build instructions

you will need the devkitpro 3ds stuff

run `./build.sh` in the terminal with the current working directory as this project

edit it to your 3ds's ip address if you want to send the 3dsx file to your 3ds in the homebrew launcher
