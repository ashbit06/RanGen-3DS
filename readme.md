# RanGen 3DS

this is a port of my [rangen ce](https://github.com/ashbit06/RanGen_CE) game for the ti-84 plus ce graphing calculator

## how to play

- dpad to move/jump
- start to exit
- left shoulder button to regenerate the map
- right shoulder button to reset your position
- x to pause and show extended player debug info

## build instructions

you will need the devkitpro 3ds stuff from [devkitpro.org](https://devkitpro.org/)

run `./build.sh` in the terminal with the current working directory as this project

add your 3ds's ip address from the homebrew launcher (press Y) with `IP_3DS="35.40.xxx.xxx"` (replace the x's with the numbers)
